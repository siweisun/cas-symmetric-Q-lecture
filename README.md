# Quantum computing and symmetric-key cryptography
## About 

- Instructor: Siwei Sun
- Lectures: 13:30 ~ 15:10, Saturday; 13:30 ~ 15:10, Sunday. (Date to be announced ...)

## Course Description

I will introduce the basics of quantum computing via linear algebra from scratch and therefore *no knowledge of quantum physics is required*. I will describe how quantum transformations can be implemented with single-qubit and two-qubit quantum gates. Then, I will clarify important metrics in synthesis and optimization of quantum circuits and show interesting research topics of quantum circuits in the context of symmetric-key cryptography. Along the way, an overview of some recent results concerning quantum circuits and symmetric-key cryptography will be provided. Then I will introduce some simple quantum algorithms and show how they are applied in symmetric-key cryptanalysis. 

## Main Topics

- One-qubit and two-qubit systems

- N-qubit system and its measurement

- Quantum transformations

- Synthesis and optimization of quantum circuits

- Simple quantum algorithms
