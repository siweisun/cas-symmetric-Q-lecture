## Course Description

I will introduce the basics of quantum computing via linear algebra from scratch and therefore *no knowledge of quantum physics is required*. I will describe how quantum transformations can be implemented with single-qubit and two-qubit quantum gates. Then, I will clarify important metrics in synthesis and optimization of quantum circuits and show interesting research topics of quantum circuits in the context of symmetric-key cryptography. Along the way, an overview of some recent results concerning quantum circuits and symmetric-key cryptography will be provided. Then I will introduce some simple quantum algorithms and show how they are applied in symmetric-key cryptanalysis.
